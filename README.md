Presumably, there are dozens of projects along these lines, but I couldn't find one that *quite* fit what I wanted and none of them have a particularly good user interface.  So, this is an attempt to build pretty much that.

**Note**:  The eventual goal is to do this with a native desktop interface, ideally using something like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), which has a decent model for building such things.  Unfortunately, nothing quite seems available yet that is straightforward to set up, portable, and quite working for my cases.  So, this project is on hold while the ideas are fleshed out in a very similar [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app, which will have a bit more overhead, but at least has everything available today.

Once that repository is working, this file will link there.
